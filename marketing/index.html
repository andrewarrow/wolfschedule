            <h4 class="">DigitalOcean<br></h4>
            <p class="">We think digital ocean is one of the best providers and use them all the time.<br></p>


            <h4 class="">Linode</h4>
            <p class="">Linode is also good. Hey these top three cloud providers are the best of the best in our opinon.<br></p>

            <h4 class="">Vultr</h4>
            <p class="">Vultr is amazing. Sure you could use aws or google or azure but we like to start with one of these three.<br></p>

                <p class="">Tell us your goals for getting into ADA staking. It could be you really don't need to run your own node. In order to make any profits you'll need 150k to 300k ADA.<br></p>
                
                <p class=""><span style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: normal;">Step 2<br></span></p>
                <p class="">If you've got the ADA we've got the time. And we've done this before. We have some software that makes it nice and "simple" to set up a node.<br></p>

                <p class="review mbr-fonts-style display-7">As your node is booting up you'll goto ADA school with us. We'll teach you what your node is doing and how to tend to it over the years. Ready? Email oneone at gmail.com and introduce yourself.<br></p>

Q. What's my competition like?
<br/>
<br/>
A. Look at a site like <a href="https://enactpool.com/">enactpool.com</a> and you'll get a sense for how your ADA pool needs a mission to get a lot of delegation from other people.

                    <br/>
Q. What's the price?
<br/>
<br/>
A. Digital Ocean, Vultr, and Linode all have their own pricing but it's very
similair between the three. For $40 a month you can get two machines that'll run
a node and relay but that's the very bottom. $80 a month is better to get
a faster CPU and plenty of space. And $160 a month is well, very nice. These 
prices are all in USD and you'll need a credit card on file with the cloud
provider.

Q. How much do I pay you?
<br/>
<br/>
A. How about 1000 ADA? We are flexible.
