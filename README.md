The above graphic shows the pattern the moon makes in number of days between “new moons” and “full moons” which happens around every 15 days, to be more specific 
[between 13.91 days and 15.61](https://gist.github.com/andrewarrow/b6c39c8898e6ae7c1d3fed6f35b150c7) and it makes a nice little sign wave with rest periods.
