How determined is the world to hold on to Monday through Friday as an official concept / way business is done?

Do you feel a little mixed up, turned around, hard to “deal” with everything going on in the world right now… did you ever not feel that way?

Coming to you from Lunar Pharmaceuticals in the summer of 2021, we bring you: the moon!

The above graphic shows the pattern the moon makes in number of days between “new moons” and “full moons” which happens around every 15 days, to be more specific 
[between 13.91 days and 15.61](https://gist.github.com/andrewarrow/b6c39c8898e6ae7c1d3fed6f35b150c7) and it makes a nice little sign wave with rest periods.

Before you try your next anti-depression fix, try a little old fashion (like farmers from the 13th century knew this) moon sync.

Here is a calendar for 2021 with a new kind of weekend / work week definition. You get two days off before and after any red number. With normal Monday thru Friday, 52 weeks a year, you get 104 days off. With this schedule you get 48 "weekends" plus 24 "event days" for total of 120 days off.

So look at the first graphic again. At every peak and every valley, you pause, rest up. And then attack the upcoming UP or DOWN work week. You’re on this crazy spaceship no matter what, might as well swim with the current?

What current does your arbitrary Monday through Friday sync with?
